# ML_Project
The goal of the project was to conduct a land cover analysis for the West Pomeranian Voivodeship (Zachodniopomorskie) in Poland using Landsat 8 satellite data. The analysis applied image classification techniques with the Random Forest algorithm, utilizing training polygons to assign appropriate land cover classes to image pixels.
